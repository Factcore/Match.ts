# Match.ts library

## Description

The implementation of the Live Football World Cup Scoreboard library that shows all the ongoing matches and their scores.

I follow next steps to implement TDD approach:
1. Define structure of the main class Match and basic types
2. Add obviously failing tests for sorting and finishin matches
3. Add returned dummy data for passing the test
4. Improve the functioanlity of the library is such way the output data doesn't change

## Getting Started

1. Copy the reposiroty

git clone https://github.com/Factcore/Match.ts.git

2. Install dependencies

npm install

3. Run test

npm run test
